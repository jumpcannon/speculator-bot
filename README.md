# speculator

A robot that speculates about things

## Usage

    $ java -jar speculator-0.1.0-standalone.jar <config>

Where <config> is a path to a file of the format

    app-key
    app-secret
    user-key
    user-secret

### Bugs

It doesn't know how to pluralize nouns with special pluralization rules, so you might find it talking about "childs" or "gooses".
